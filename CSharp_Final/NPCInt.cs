    /*THINGS WE NEED:
    - NPC Health DONE
    - NPC "Moves" (attack, wait, damage, ect. Must incorporate into combat system)
    - Specialized NPCs such as enemies, shopkeepers, and questgivers
    - Dialogue for every NPC that they can say
    (i.e. shopkeeper will tell you about items, enemies might taunt you if they're human, ect)
    - A boolean to track whether they're human or not (?)
    - A way for a room to contain/hold an NPC. This could either be in rooms or in NPCs systems
    - A way to tell the player that there is an NPC in the room (can incorporate w/ ^), i.e. discovery dialogue
